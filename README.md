# Gajdy-GDPS

Extract the zip file anywhere you want and instal "Gajdy GDPS beta 1.0.APK" on your android device (does not work if you have android 11+ on these devices: Motorola, Cat, Google phones because google is blocking apps from unknown source, even when tey are safe)
EXE version soon but if you really want to play it on pc you can use GDHM Tasbot v34.18 by Adaf to switch servers (https://adaf.xyz/adaf/hm/download/v34.18/b0fc84427313fb6168479888b3614da4f1004426987880ce5175a6d854069ed4/)
